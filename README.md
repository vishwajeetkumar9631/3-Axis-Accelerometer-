# 3-Axis-Accelerometer-
This is a 3-axis accelerometer using  which is made up of the FPGA using the NEXSYS 4 using SPI Protocol .

A 3-axis accelerometer is used to calculate the pitch and roll of the drilling bit.
The 3-axis accelerometer consists of three -5 to +5g accelerometers that are mounted on a block. It measures the three mutually orthogonal components of the acceleration of gravity for a stationary drill bit.
The attitude information includes the pitch, roll, and azimuth of the drilling bit. By measuring the acceleration due to gravity, an accelerometer calculates the angle of tilt with respect to the earth and the velocity and direction of the drill bit.
To compensate for errors, two redundant accelerometers fixed at two different planes are used.
The 3-axis accelerometer is used in conjunction with compatible software. Inertial guidance systems use fiber-optic gyroscopes along with highly sensitive accelerometers to locate the drill head precisely along the borepath.
The connection of the optical gyro system from downhole to the surface is done via a transmission system that sends the pitch, roll and azimuth readings three times in a second providing the engineer with real-time measurements.
The pitch and the azimuth should be determined during the drilling process to operate the drilling machine economically hence using the term measurement while drilling or MWD.
The inertial guidance system is used for drilling head guidance in trenchless construction methods of vertical drilling and horizontal directional drilling (HDD) and relies on knowing the initial position, velocity, and attitude.

SPI CONTROL PROTOCOL 

Serial peripheral interface (SPI) is one of the most widely used interfaces between microcontroller and peripheral ICs such as sensors, ADCs, DACs, shift registers, SRAM, and others. This article provides a brief description of the SPI interface followed by an introduction to Analog Devices’ SPI enabled switches and muxes, and how they help reduce the number of digital GPIOs in system board design.
SPI is a synchronous, full duplex main-subnode-based interface. The data from the main or the subnode is synchronized on the rising or falling clock edge. Both main and subnode can transmit data at the same time. The SPI interface can be either 3-wire or 4-wire. This article focuses on the popular 4-wire SPI interface.
4-wire SPI devices have four signals:
⦁	Clock (SPI CLK, SCLK)
⦁	Chip select (CS)
⦁	main out, subnode in (MOSI)
⦁	main in, subnode out (MISO)

The device that generates the clock signal is called the main. Data transmitted between the main and the subnode is synchronized to the clock generated by the main. SPI devices support much higher clock frequencies compared to I2C interfaces. Users should consult the product data sheet for the clock frequency specification of the SPI interface.
SPI interfaces can have only one main and can have one or multiple subnodes. Figure 1 shows the SPI connection between the main and the subnode.
The chip select signal from the main is used to select the subnode. This is normally an active low signal and is pulled high to disconnect the subnode from the SPI bus. When multiple subnodes are used, an individual chip select signal for each subnode is required from the main. In this article, the chip select signal is always an active low signal.
MOSI and MISO are the data lines. MOSI transmits data from the main to the subnode and MISO transmits data from the subnode to the main.
